  My plan for my project that I will be implementing in Python 3.5.2 is a program
  that gives a file a mature-content based rating, based on sexual, violent, and adult
  content and language.  This rating will be based off of an algorithm that includes how
  many words in the document could be considered sexual, violent, or adult-themed compared
  to how many total words are in the document. A database will be utilized to store three
  types of words that could be considered mature, which will be categorized as sexual words,
  violent words, or curse words. Before the document is processed, the user will be prompted
  to select from a list of options on whether they want to rate a file, add a word to the database,
  remove the word from the a, or quit the program. This will allow the user to have a rating more
  individualized for their needs. When the algorithm calculates the maturity rating of the current file,

  October 31st: Shell Work
  November 7th: Database Schema designed
  November 21st: Database interaction complete
  December 8th: Finished Project

  Requirements: Python 3.5.2
                psycopg2

        To install the necessary modules, use command line sudo apt install psycopg2

        To run project, run the Python compiler on main.py and the program will begin

  Looking back on this project, I put it aside more than I should have. As a result,
  it is not what I really expected it to be. I have a lot of bugs that will need to
  be revised before December 15th that I can hopefully fix. This project did teach
  me a lot about Python and the syntax and structure it has
