Language Choice: Python

I have decided to do Python mainly because most of the job offerings I have
looked through mention that Python is one certain language they are looking for.
I believe getting the experience of this project using Python will help me in
the long run more than any of the other languages on the list. Also, since
Python is object-oriented, I believe it will be easy for me to learn and be able
to produce a project worth showing future employers even though the syntax is a
lot different than Java.
