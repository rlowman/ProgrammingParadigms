CS 315 Programming Paradigms

Example 1: I notice that there is a reallocation of the current pointer to the
size and I noticed that this pointer returned from the realloc function that
points to the newly allocated memory is casted to void *. I predict this is
casted in such a way so that any type of value can be passed as a return value
and it won't be an issue until it as casted after it is returned.

Example 2: If you give the input of just an underscore, the only thing that is
returned is an underscore however the cursor moves to the very next line instead
of 2 lines down if you were to give it a letter it knows. When given with a
number or a known letter, the program will print the letter or number correctly
but will repeat the underscore respectively to its location in the input. This
is because the underscore is not part of our grammer and therefore the program
does not know how to handle it for output, so it resorts to simply repeating it
in the output. 

Example 3:
KEYWORD: class
IDENTIFIER: StudentInfo
PUNCTUATION: {
KEYWORD: public
PUNCTUATION: :
IDENTIFIER: StudentInfo
PUNCTUATION: (
PUNCTUATION: )
PUNCTUATION: {
IDENTIFIER: myGPA
OPERATOR: =
DOUBLE: 0.0 (0)
PUNCTUATION: ;
IDENTIFIER: myHours
OPERATOR: =
INTEGER: 0 (0)
PUNCTUATION: ;
PUNCTUATION: }
IDENTIFIER: StudentInfo
PUNCTUATION: (
KEYWORD: double
IDENTIFIER: gpa
PUNCTUATION: ,
KEYWORD: int
IDENTIFIER: hours
PUNCTUATION: )
PUNCTUATION: {
IDENTIFIER: myGPA
OPERATOR: =
IDENTIFIER: gpa
PUNCTUATION: ;
IDENTIFIER: myHours
OPERATOR: =
IDENTIFIER: hours
PUNCTUATION: ;
PUNCTUATION: }
KEYWORD: private
PUNCTUATION: :
KEYWORD: double
IDENTIFIER: myGPA
PUNCTUATION: ;
KEYWORD: int
IDENTIFIER: myHours
PUNCTUATION: ;
PUNCTUATION: }
PUNCTUATION: ;

Example 4: 
- The difference between a terminal and a non-terminal is that

- One thing I noticed is that the program isn't really sure if the heat was
turned off or on, it just knows that the state of the power has changed. I
noticed this as the output for both inputs "Heat on" and "Heat off" is the same.
Also, unlike the other programs in this lab so far, if the program does not
recognize a syntax it crashes and ends the program, compared to the other
programs that will simply reprint input it does not recognize. Having said that
I also find it strange that our program crashes when we enter a lone integer,
even though 0-9 is in our grammer as NUMBER.
